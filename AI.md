# AI Usage Log

**Project:** Ego Chatbot  
**AI Tool used:** ChatGPT

## Case 1: Generate more JUnit Tests
- Used to generate more JUnit tests for my Storage
and Parser classes
- It managed to create new test cases for other methods
especially in my Parser class
- It saved potentially around 30 minutes of time compared
to if I were to write the test cases myself
- Overall, it was a great addition that sped up my work,
it was also a good way to validate my own thought
process and see if it concurs with ChatGPT
