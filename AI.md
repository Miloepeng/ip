# AI Usage Log

**Project:** Ego Chatbot  
**AI Tool used:** ChatGPT

## Case 1: Generate more JUnit Tests
- Used to generate more JUnit tests for my Storage
and Parser classes
- It managed to create new test cases for other methods
especially in my Parser class
- It saved potentially around 30 minutes of time compared
to if I were to write the test cases myself
- Overall, it was a great addition that sped up my work,
it was also a good way to validate my own thought
process and see if it concurs with ChatGPT

## Case 2: Generate exit flow upon 'bye' command
- Used to generate exit flow to save the tasks and close
the GUI interface upon the command 'bye'
- Potentially saved another 10 minutes of my time compared
to if I were to do it myself
- It was also not buggy which was surprising given that the 
codebase is quite huge by now. However, the prompt seems to
be quite important, have to be clear in your instructions
